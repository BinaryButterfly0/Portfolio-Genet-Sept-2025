The logs are systematically categorized based on server typesâ€”including Windows, Linux, and Web serversâ€”and protocols such as DNS, HTTP, SSH, and Zeek. By organizing logs in this way, the project enables efficient monitoring, correlation of events, and rapid detection of anomalies or security incidents across diverse IT environments. This structured approach helps security analysts gain actionable insights and maintain robust system security.",

By analyzing TLS traffic, students gain practical skills in identifying outdated protocols, suspicious certificates, and potential misuse of encrypted channels, enhancing their ability to monitor and secure network communications effectively.",

Threats are analyzed by correlating events, identifying attacker behavior, and determining the scope of compromise. All findings are logged and documented to support reporting, forensic analysis, and improving security measures.",
